            Here, for simplicity, we use a general approach of token-based
            authentication.
            Once the user is authenticated via regular HTTP protocol, then
            it can query for a specific endpoint returning a token associated
            with the logged in user.
            Such token can then be sent as part of handshake when the first WS
            message is sent.
